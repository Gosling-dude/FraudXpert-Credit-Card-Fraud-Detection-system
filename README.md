# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a credit card fraud detection system using a logistic regression model. The dataset is synthetically generated, and the model is trained to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Features

- Logistic regression with an 87% accuracy
- Feature engineering to improve performance
- Hyperparameter tuning and undersampling to handle class imbalance
- Precision, recall, and F1 score metrics

## Files and Directories

- `data/creditcard_data.csv`: Contains the synthetic dataset
- `src/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and utilities
- `output/`: Trained model and evaluation metrics
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for exploration and model building

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
